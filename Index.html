   On a chicken farm, a worker looks up. It is nothing he has seen before the sky was purple
   He panicked because he notice something aproaching from the sky. He loses all train of thought, inside he knew what he had to do
   That was to protect the chickens. Although he desides to chose his human instinks and run. He didn't know where he was going
   because fear has clouded up his mind 
   He looked back and stared at the only thing he has ever known 
   As humans we shouldn't stare and gaze at the past to move on we have to move forward 
   He crashed into a mechine and was inpeld 
   A tear has shed from his eye but not from the pain
