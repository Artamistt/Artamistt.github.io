   On a chicken farm, a worker looks up. It is nothing he has seen before the sky was purple
   He panicked because he notice something aproaching from the sky. He loses all train of thought, inside he knew what he had to do
   That was to protect the chickens. Although he desides to chose his human instinks and run. He didn't know where he was going
   because fear has clouded up his mind 
   He looked back and stared at the only thing he has ever known 
   As humans we shouldn't stare and gaze at the past to move on we have to move forward 
   He crashed into a mechine and was inpeld 
   A tear has shed from his eye but not from the pain 
   but it was cause he knew the last thing he had ever did was run
   Like a filthy coward, Instead of being with his Ma or even his chickens
   Being around the ones he loved but he chose his fate
   The flying object had landed and distroyed half of the farm 
   From inside was a being from a another planet 
   Pasted out and not knowing what had just happened 
   She woke up and noticed she was not home 
   She had no memory its as if she had her memory wiped by the hit on the crash
